                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p><!--- <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic25.jpg" alt=""/></span> --->
                    I worked on the autonomous boat project together with four people. It was a Robotics Club project. It was
                    built to compete with other boats on a racing track. Track was a closed loop, that had some obstacles
                    on it. Boat which did the most laps in five minutes won the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The boat uses three IR sensors to gather data of its surroundings. Using that data best path is
                    calculated. The boat has two motors. The boat turns itself by changing its motor speeds. The boats hull
                    and cover were modelled in Solidworks and 3D printed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mainly focused on mechanical design, putting boat parts together and waterproofing it. I did a little
                    electronics and some coding as well.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Waterproofing</h3>
                <p>
                    Waterproofing was very difficult, because motors were inside the boat and there had to be shaft, that
                    goes through the boat hull. That was the main place for leakage. We were able to fix this leakage, by
                    using a tube around shaft, that had larger diameter and then we sealed everything with silicone.
                </p>
                <h3>Sensors</h3>
                <p>
                    Sensors weren't very accurate and that caused some problems. Sometimes it would give us just random numbers.
                    We overcame this problem, by changing sensors from 5V mode to 3V mode and taking average value from multiple
                    readings.

                <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think, that we did pretty good job building this boat, but if we had more time, then we could have improved
                    some things.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Boat cover and hull connection</b> - We just used bolts and nuts, but this was very inconvenient.</li>
                    <li><b>On/Off switch</b> - We used an switch that was inside the boat and we had a different button to
                        start the code. We could just use one switch for both and mount it on the boat cover.</li>
                    <li><b>Electronics</b> - It is possible to make the connections on electronics board better, shorter and
                        more reliable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I learned?</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned, how to model parts for 3D printing. I found out, what details could be printed and what
                    details are hard to print. I got some experience using STM nucleo and programming it.
