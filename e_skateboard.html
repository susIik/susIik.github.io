                    I started this project, because I wanted to get myself a electric skateboard, but I always thought
                    that having a remote in one hand is inconvenient. So I wanted to make a electric skateboard that
                    works without a remote. There were multiple options for that. I decided to go with strain sensors.
                    Strain sensors are mounted to both skateboard trucks. That allows to measure the strain in both
                    truck and as well calculate weight that is applied to both trucks. I made a program, that calculates
                    the difference between those weights and according to that sets the motor speed.

                <h2>Struggles</h2>
                <h3>Mounting the pulley</h3>
                <p>
                    It should have been a easy task, but I didn't have all the right tools for the job and this made it
                    very difficult. Difficult part was drilling straight holes through the wheel. I had to do it with a
                    hand drill. Turns out, that it wasn't a good idea. Hand drilled holes weren't straight and I had to
                    make those wider, so that the bolts could go through the holes straight.
                </p>
                <h3>Installing the strain gauges</h3>
                <p>
                    Gluing stain gauges to the truck was an easy part, but soldering the wires to the strain gauges was
                    really hard. Those strain gauge solder pads were very small and it made it difficult to get the wire
                    right on top of the solder pad. I did destroy few of the strain gauges before I was able to wire
                    everything up correctly.

                <h2>What could be improved</h2>
                <p>
                    There definitely are many things, that could be improved in this project. But I'm gonna list here
                    few of those.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wiring on trucks</b> - At the moment the wiring on the trucks is little bit a mess. It could be done
                        better and sealing the wires from possible outside damages could be better.</li>
                    <li><b>Pulley attachment to the wheel</b> - Pulley could be further away from the wheel, because right now
                        it's too close.</li>
                    <li><b>Battery indicator</b> - Current solution is that you need to open the case up to see the battery voltages.
                        It would be nice, if there was an indicator outside the box that is easy to check.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>
                    That was the first time, that I had to solder together decent amount of components. I definitely improved my
                    soldering skills during this project. I had soldered before, but I didn't know much about it. During
                    this project I got a lot of new knowledge from different tutorial videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing the code and wiring up Arduino. I had never used Arduino before. I learned about different ports on
                    arduino and how to use them. Most importantly I learned how to get inputs from different sensors and
                    how to output signal. In this project I outputted PWM signal to control motor speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Controlling the motor speed was another thing I learned during this project. I learned some things about
                    ESCs, how they function and how to use them for motor speed controlling.
